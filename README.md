## What's Cabrinha?

Cabrinha is a suite of extensible components of the [OP Stack][op-stack].

Built on top of these components, the [execution extension][exex] offers an executable that runs the full [OP Stack][op-stack] as a singular process.

## Development Status

`cabrinha` is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use in production.

## Book

The [book][book] contains a more in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, tutorials for getting started with building your own OP Stack components.

## Credits

`cabrinha` is inspired by the work of several teams, namely [OP Labs][op-labs] and other contributors' work on [`kona`][kona].
